I created this voice assistant to help dive into API's and Virtual Machine Learning. I used Googles API and Gemini to build the bot. You can ask it a question and it will speak to you within 500 characters or you can mute it and speak chat with it inside the chat box. I made it 500 characters to avoid long drawn out chats. I also disabled all filters, so you will get unfiltered answers while using the chat bot. 

To use add your OWN GOOGLE API

Upcoming plans: Add user voice input and voice registartion from the AI.
